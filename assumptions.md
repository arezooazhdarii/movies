# Movies API

## assumptions

Going by the initial assumption, I thought it must be just
an endpoint  that is to get all data are “Best Picture” and
winners from 1927 until 2010 from academy_award table, and that getting the title and year after that send requests to API, The API response would then show result a list of 10 top-rated movies ordered by box office value.
